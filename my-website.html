                <p>I am born and raised in Dallas, Texas. I have four siblings and am the middle child. I love to pour into people's lives and help them turn their dreams into accomplished goals! Say that I love to travel is an understatement. I have been all over the US and overseas too. I always get asked "which place was the best?" and for me they all offered something different that I appreciated. I try to talk to people about their travels or encourage them to travel. Not everyone can afford to go outside of the country but we all can take the weekend and enjoy the city that we call home.</p>

                <p>I am looking for a career change. I have been in marketing for a very long time and I am planning on proposing to my girlfriend in July. My current job I travel a lot and I want something that gives me the flexibility to work from home and still pays well. Getting into tech will allow those things and more that I cannot forsee right now. The photo that you see is what I use to do. Traveling the US managing events for an automotive company and I really loved it!</p>
